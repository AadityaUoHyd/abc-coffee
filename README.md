# ABC Coffee Shop
This landing page was built using HTML and CSS as part of a design brief for a fictional caf√©, ABC Coffee Shop, located in Hyderabad, India. 
The project served as a hands-on exercise to simulate a real-world, functional landing page. It currently consists of a single page with 
self-referential links and is not expected to receive future updates, as it was created during the early stages of my software engineering journey.

Despite its simplicity, this project significantly helped me get comfortable with tools and techniques such as Flexbox, absolute positioning, 
CSS animations, embedding content with iframes, and more during my starter days. I just deloped it today to test github free deploy.
All the cpffee bookings will go to `abc@yopmail.com` as settings in web3forms.
